1 - PACK SIMILAR DATA TYPES TOGETHER
2 - USE UINT256 IF USING SEPERATELY, NOT IN PACK
3 - Elements in Memory and Call Data cannot be packed. 
4 - it’s cheaper to use arrays if you are using smaller elements like uint8 which can be packed together
5 - There is no gas saving in solidity by using smaller variables in function calls and memory.
6 - make less external calls
7 - If your function is only called externally, then you should explicitly mark it as external. External function’s parameters are not copied into memory but are read from calldata directly.
8 - Use && , || precisely such that no need to evaluate second statement.
